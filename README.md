# Bomb-Lab
<h2>DePaul University - System I - Winter 2017</h2>
<h3>**Note: I made this repo with the intent to help others solve their own Bomb Labs and also showcase my thought process on how to come across the solutions for each. With that being said, please feel free to fork or star this repo if you find it helpful!***</h3>

  <ul><strong>Goals:</strong>
    <li>Solve a total of 6 phases to defuse the bomb. Each phase has a password/key that is solved through the hints found within the assembly code.</li>
    <li>Become familiar with Linux VM and Linux command-line</li>
    <li>Use and navigate through gdb debugger to examine memory and registers, view assembly code, and set breakpoints within the gdb debugger</li>
    <li>Read and understand low level assembly code</li>
    <li>Understand control flow in assembly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details on Grading for Bomb Lab</h3>

<ul>Point breakdown for each phase:
  <li>Phase 1 - 4: 10 points each</li>
  <li>Phase 5 and 6: 15 points each</li>
  <li><strong>Total maximum score possible: 70 points</strong></li>
  </ul>
  

  Each time the "bomb explodes", it notifies the server, resulting in a (-)1/5 point deduction from the final score for the lab.
